                  <h3>Taking care of your Password (Password security)</h3>
                  <p>
                    Adventz firmly believes in protecting the personal
                    information of the customer. Adventz or any of its staff or
                    official will never ask for any password or related
                    information from its customers and the customers are also
                    advised, in order to protect access to their accounts and to
                    other channels, do not disclose the passwords to anyone. It
                    is recommended that the customers necessarily choose their
                    own passwords carefully such that no unauthorized access is
                    made by a third party. You are also advised not to keep any
                    written or other record of the password/s so that no third
                    party could access the same. You should not disclose the
                    password to anyone. In order that the passwords become
                    complex and difficult for others to guess the you should
                    carefully choose the alpha numeric passwords with
                    combination of upper case alphabets and numbers and special
                    characters (like @, %, &, ! etc.) The password is a private
                    information and must be kept confidential by the owner of
                    the username related to the password. If a password is known
                    by someone other than the owner, that username and password
                    could be misused to access resources and information and
                    possibly with criminal intent—and without notice since they
                    would appear as the registered owner. We will bear no
                    responsibility for loss caused to you in relation to
                    password theft or unauthorized access due to weak passwords
                    etc.
